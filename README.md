# Sentiment-Analysis-ML

This project uses Amazon Sagemakers and Pytorch, some of the template code was provided by Udacity. The goal of this project is to create a web page that can take user's review 
as an input, and predicts an output of positive or negative based on the input.

Project Overview:
The data provided by udacity is first downloaded. Within the notebook the data is explored. The data was already pretty much clean, so not much was done to it. 
Model is built and trained using pytorch XGBoost. 
Instructions(provided by Udacity):

	Download or otherwise retrieve the data.
	Process / Prepare the data.
	Upload the processed data to S3.
	Train a chosen model.
	Test the trained model (typically using a batch transform job).
	Deploy the trained model.
	Use the deployed model.

Libraries: scikit-learn, nltk, pickle, numpy, pytorch and more
